Secrets 
>> Authentication >> Autherization
Uername/Passwords
DB Credentials ... API Tokens ...TLS certificates.
why ?? what we see is a secret sprawl.... In Plain Text ..Source Code / configuration files / VCS.. sprawled all over the infrastructure.
How to do the rotation.
Valut resolves the secret sprawl probelm..by centralizing this. Encryption at rest as well as in-transit between vault and any of the clients that want to access it.
Fine grained ACL (Access control list)
Audit (Strong visibility to this)
Logs .. Diagnostics ..Monitoring
Second level capability is dynamic Secret : Dyanmic secters are ephemeral, unique , Revoke specific target
we might put encryption keys inside the vault then distribute the key back out to the application. The application is doing cryptography to protect data at rest.
But what if application is not doing cryptography correctly. 
Different capability is known as Encrypt as a Service
Instead of handover encyption key to developer , Vault will do certain things. It will let you create a set of named keys.
Named Keys : and provide High level APIs .. which do the operations like Encryption, Decryption, Signature, Verify.
We get the full key life-cycle as well provided by the vault.
Through a series of key management and high level cryptographic offload.
Valut is highly pluggable ..it has many different plug-in mechanisms
Core ... plugin Authentication 
some plugins are : EC2 VM AWS, LDAP/AD, K8S, KN, Database , RabbitMq, AWS, PKI, SSH,
